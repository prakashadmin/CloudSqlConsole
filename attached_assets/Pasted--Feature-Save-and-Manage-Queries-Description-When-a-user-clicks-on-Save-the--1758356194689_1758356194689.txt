
### **Feature: Save and Manage Queries**

**Description:**
When a user clicks on **Save**, the system should prompt for a query name. Once saved, queries will appear in the highlighted section of the UI. Query visibility is controlled by user roles.

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Save Query**

   * On clicking **Save**, a dialog must appear asking for a *Query Name*.
   * Query metadata should include:

     * `query_id` (UUID / unique identifier)
     * `query_name` (string, user-provided)
     * `query_text` (SQL content)
     * `created_by` (user\_id)
     * `role` (role of the user saving it)
     * `created_at` (timestamp)

2. **Role-Based Visibility**

   * **User role:** Can only view their own saved queries.
   * **Developer role:** Can view all queries saved by any Developer.
   * **Admin role:** Can view all queries saved by *User* and *Developer* roles.

3. **UI Display**

   * Saved queries must be listed in the highlighted section.
   * Queries should be grouped or filterable by role for easy navigation.

### **Acceptance Criteria & Test Cases**

✅ **Save Functionality**

* [ ] When user clicks Save → prompt appears for Query Name.
* [ ] Saving without a name should show a validation error.
* [ ] After saving, query appears in highlighted section instantly.

✅ **Role Permissions**

* [ ] A User can only see their own queries (verify with 2 different User accounts).
* [ ] A Developer can see all queries created by Developers (verify with multiple Developer accounts).
* [ ] An Admin can see all queries created by Users + Developers.
* [ ] Admin should not miss any Developer/User queries.

✅ **Data Integrity**

* [ ] Saved query persists in DB after logout/login.
* [ ] Query name must be unique per user (optional: allow overwrite confirmation).
* [ ] Query text must remain intact (no truncation).

✅ **Edge Cases**

* [ ] Empty SQL text should not be saved.
* [ ] Large query (e.g., >10k characters) should still save properly.
* [ ] Multiple users saving simultaneously should not overwrite each other’s queries.

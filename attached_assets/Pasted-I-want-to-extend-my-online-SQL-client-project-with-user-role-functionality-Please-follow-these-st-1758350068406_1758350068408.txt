I want to extend my online SQL client project with user role functionality. 
Please follow these steps carefully and do not introduce bugs:

1. Add a user management system with authentication (username + password).
   - Use a secure library for password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
   - Store users in a proper users table with their role type.

2. Define three roles with strict permissions:
   - Role 1: **Admin**
     - Can add new users.
     - Can add/manage database connections.
     - Full access to execute queries.
   - Role 2: **Developer**
     - Can only execute queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
     - Cannot add databases.
     - Cannot add users.
   - Role 3: **Business User**
     - Can only execute **read-only (SELECT)** queries.
     - Cannot run INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, or CREATE commands.
     - Cannot add databases or users.

3. Enforce role-based access control (RBAC):
   - Before executing any SQL query, check the user role.
   - If a Developer tries to add a database or a user → deny with a clear error message.
   - If a Business User tries to execute non-SELECT queries → deny with a clear error message.

4. Implement a clean admin panel (web-based):
   - Admin can create new users and assign roles.
   - Provide a form where admin selects role type from a dropdown (Admin / Developer / Business User).

5. After implementation, create a **test script**:
   - Create one Admin, one Developer, and one Business User.
   - Show examples:
     - Admin successfully creates a new Developer.
     - Developer runs an UPDATE query successfully but fails when trying to add a user.
     - Business User runs a SELECT query successfully but fails when trying an UPDATE.

6. Please make sure:
   - The code runs **without bugs** in Replit.
   - Test script should execute automatically and show console output confirming the role restrictions are working.
   - Add comments in the code explaining each step so it’s easy to maintain.

Now implement this step by step, test it, and show me the test results.
